I hope you will enjoy them.\n\n **NOTE: This step is completely optional.**\n This cog contains `eject` and `petpet` commands, which utilises premium endpoints of <https://some-random-api.ml> and hence (as of now) they require an API key.\n You can get one by joining their support server at https://discord.gg/tTUMWFd and first sending `-vote` command in their <#486512896055050240> channel which will prompt you to upvote their server on top.gg.\n Once you have upvoted so, you can claim your API key by sending `-claim` command in that same channel. A bot should DM you your API key.\n Each time you upvote their server on top.gg (at minimum 12 hours interval), you receive a claim of **5 days** of their API premium, which you can claim with `-claim` in their server.\n\n Once you have received the API key, you can do:\n```[p]set api srapi api_key <your_api_key>\n```\n These 2 commands will remain hidden from help menu/unavailable until you set the API key, but remaining commands of this cog does not require any API key.",
