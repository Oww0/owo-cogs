## Pre-requisites

âš  NOTE: Installing pre-requisites and all of Manim's dependencies + Docker image may take considerable amount of disk space (roughly from 1GB up to 4GB if TeX packages are also installed).

* First install docker for your OS where you are running/hosting your Red instance.
* Install required dependencies for Manim from: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html


## Pull Manim docker image

by using this command in your terminal (may require you to run with sudo):
```
docker pull manimcommunity/manim:v0.6.0
```
It may take sometime to download+extract this docker image, depending on your ISP host provider's internet speed.
Once it's done, check if its successfully downloaded with:
```
$ docker images -a
REPOSITORY             TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED      SIZE
manimcommunity/manim   v0.6.0    d8b0877c8c7e   2 weeks ago   1.58GB
```

# Install manim cog
```
# Add this repo, if haven't already
[p]repo add owo-cogs https://github.com/siu3334/owo-cogs

# Install cog
[p]cog install owo-cogs manim

# Load the cog
[p]load manim
```

If it's loaded successfully, then try evaluating a Manim code snippet with `[p]manimate` command like this:

Or pick a code snippet from Manim's example gallery to try out for demo: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html
