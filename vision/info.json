This cog utilizes Google Cloud Vision API, which will require you to have a active Google Cloud project (with billing enabled).\nIf you have an active Cloud project, go to this link to enable the Cloud Vision API:\n <https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=vision.googleapis.com>\n\n Once you have enabled this API, go to Credentials section: <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials> to create an API key, if you haven't created one already.\n\nâ€¢ If you have previously created an unrestricted API key or created an API key just now, then copy that API key.\nâ€¢ If you have a restricted API key, you will need to include Cloud Vision API into Selected APIs for this API key (Note: It may take up to 5 minutes for settings to take effect.). Then copy the API key.\n\n You can now set your API key with:\n```[p]set api google_vision api_key <copied_api_key>\n``` \n That's all you need to do. Now load the cog and test an image through OCR. ðŸ˜Š",
